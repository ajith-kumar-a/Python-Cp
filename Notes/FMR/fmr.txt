    -> map, filter and reduce are paradigms of functional programming
    -> map and filter com built-in with python(built in function)
    -> reduce , need to be imported as it resides in the functool module

    -> Syntax
        filter(function,iterable)
        -> function : it tests if each element of a sequence true or not
        -> Sequence : which need to be filtered , it can be list sets, tuples or containiners of any iterators

    -> Lambda Function(Anonoymous Function) -> function without a name
    -> this function can take any number of arguments but only one expression , which is evaluated and returned 

    syntax : lambda arguments : expression

    -> map() function return a map object(which is an iterators) of the result
       after applying the given function to each item of a given iterable(list,tuples, etc....)
       or allows you to process and transform all the items in an iterable
       without using an explicit for loop , a technique commonly known as mapping
    syntax
        map(function,iterable,[iterable1,iterable2......])
